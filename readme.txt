== Description ==

= Create New Ad Revenue In Minutes =
Introducing a consent-based ad network exclusively for engaging ad blocking audiences. With One Click Consent you pay nothing, make money, and we do the work!

= The Problem =
Ad blocker usage is at an all-time high. This causes a variety of difficulties for websites (even ones that don't depend on selling ads).

= The Solution = 

We've made it simple. Our technology allows ad block users to opt-in to advertising and other services with our proprietary One-click Consent, engaging them via high quality, open and transparent messaging and serving ads.

We implement continuous multi-variate testing to optimize messaging, communication and ad placement strategies on your site(s) to maximize conversions using one-click consent technology

= Accurate Ad Blocking Measurement =

Utilize our technology for ad blocking analytics even if you don't want ads or messaging on your site. 

= Optimized =

We constantly build out our proprietary technology, strategy and partnerships to maximize your revenue.

= New Revenue =

We pay you and retain a small percentage from the revenue we have created.

= We Play Nice =

We work alongside other technology and do not take away from any other revenue streams.

= Teammates =

We are 100% aligned with our partners – if you are not making money, we aren't either.

== Changelog ==

= 5.0.0.15 =
* Updated this readme file with more information.
= 5.0.1.1 =
* Some JS which was included out-of-line by the plugin is blocked by some ad blockers. This release moves that JS inline. Support for older plugins with out-of-line JS is also provided.
* Fixed bug in readme.txt which was hopefully due to an invalid character. Oddly, the earlier readme passed the WordPress readme validator. Maybe that needs to be upgraded?
= 5.0.1.2 =

Tested plugin on WordPress versions up to WordPress version 5.2.1
